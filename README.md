**📚 Mastering Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 🚀**

Object-Oriented Programming is essential for organizing code in a way that mirrors real-world relationships 🌍. It makes complex software easier to maintain, extend, and understand 👩‍💻👨‍💻. With OOP, we use concepts like Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism to build modular, reusable, and scalable code!

**💡 Real-World Example: Library Management System 📖🏫**

If anyone wants to build software for a library! 📚 Without OOP, he’d have scattered structures and functions to handle everything from Books to Users to Loans — not very scalable! OOP brings clarity and order. 🧩

**🌟 How OOP Enhances the Library System**

**1. 🏷️ Classes and Objects 🛠️**
Classes represent real-world entities like Books, Users, and Loans. Each has its own properties (attributes) and actions (methods).

**Book Class 📘:** Attributes like title, author, ISBN, and methods like **borrow()** and **return().**
**User Class 🧑‍🏫:** Attributes like name, userID, and methods like **checkOutBook()** and **returnBook()**.

**2. 🔐 Encapsulation 🔒**
Encapsulation secures each class's data by hiding it from others, exposing only essential functions.
For example, the owner of the library wouldn’t want a User to modify a Book’s ISBN directly! Only the Book class has control, ensuring safe data updates and preventing misuse.

**3. 🧬 Inheritance 🔗**
Inheritance reduces redundancy by allowing new classes to build on existing ones.
LibraryUser Base Class 🏛️: Has common properties like userID and name.
**StudentUser 🎓** and **TeacherUser 🧑‍🏫** inherit from LibraryUser but have their own unique attributes or methods.

**4. 🎭 Polymorphism ✨**
Polymorphism enables different classes to be used interchangeably if they share the same methods.
Both **StudentUser** and **TeacherUser** might have **checkOutBook()**, allowing the **LibraryUser** class to handle them both seamlessly without worrying about their specific types.

**5.Abstraction :**  A **Book** class might have a **borrow()** method. Abstraction ensures that when User interacts with **borrow()**, they don't need to know how it’s implemented internally,whether it updates a database, performs checks, or logs transactions. They simply know that calling **borrow()** will allow them to borrow a book if available.

**🌈 Benefits of OOP in This Scenario**

**Modular Code 🧩:** Each class is responsible for its own logic, making bug tracking and updates a breeze.

**Reusability 🔄:** Anyone can use classes across different parts of the program or in new projects!

**Scalability 📈:** Anyone can add new classes or subclasses (like DigitalBook) without breaking existing code.

**Maintainability ⚙️:** Anyone can change one part of the program (e.g., updating the loan process) without affecting others — thanks to encapsulation!


OOP helps us build a structure that resembles the real world 🌍, making code intuitive and manageable — especially as the project grows and evolves over time! 🛠️

__In my first year at university, I learned C#. I have compiled all the basics of C# here, with explanations where necessary using comments. Anyone can easily understand the basics of C# with this repository. I have also included some basic problems for practice.__
