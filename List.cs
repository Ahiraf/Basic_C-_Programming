//"List" is same as "Array" used to store multiple values in a single variable .
//Differences between List and Array : 
//i) "Array" is List of items where one knows before hand how many 
// elements are gonna be in list. But in case "List", one does not know before hand how many elements are gonna be in list.
//ii) "Array" is faster but "List" is slower.
