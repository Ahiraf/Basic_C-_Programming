//Poly means 'Many'.
//Morphism means 'Forms/Behaviors'.
//Polymorphism means having many forms/behaviors.
//'+' operator is used for Addition of two integer. For exmaple : 10 + 20 = 30 
// It is also used for joining two Strings . For example : "Spider" + "Man" = Spiderman.
// It can be said polymorphism of '+' operator.
//So,if we use '+' operator between two int value it will add them up but if we use it between two strings it will concatenate them.
// Two types polymorphism in C# , 
//  i) Compile time polymorphism : Static Polymorphism , and we can achieve it by Method of Overloading 
//  ii) Run time Polymorphism : Dynamic Polymorphism , and we can achieve it by Method of Overriding .
